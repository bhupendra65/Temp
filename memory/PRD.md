# Matsyavan — Fisherman Assistant Bot · PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Final year engineering project: **Matsyavan – Fish Farming Monitoring System** with a unified chatbot **Fisherman Assistant Bot** featuring 5 sub-bots (Problem Diagnosis, Weather + Rain Alert, Feed Calculator, Market Price, FAQ). Requirement: **LIVE data** wherever possible (Open-Meteo mandatory, market prices live-try + CSV fallback). Keyword-based intent routing. Bonus: Hindi/Marathi + timestamps + alert-style warnings.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI (`/app/backend/server.py`) + modular `bots/` package (intent, weather, market, feed, diagnosis, faq, translate)
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui chat UI at `/app/frontend/src/pages/{Landing,Chat}.jsx`
- **Database**: MongoDB (chat_messages collection for session history)
- **Data**: `/app/backend/data/fish_prices.csv` (10 species base prices)

## User Persona
Indian fish-farmer / aquaculture owner (pond, tank, cage). Mobile-first, calloused-hand tap targets, multilingual (EN/HI/MR), outdoor-glare-friendly contrast.

## Core Requirements (static)
- Unified chatbot with 5 intents routed by keyword classifier
- LIVE Open-Meteo weather (no key) with 3-day forecast + heavy-rain alert banner
- Near-live market prices (CSV + deterministic daily variance) with sell/hold advisory
- Feed calculator (weight × count × stage-based feeding rate × species multiplier)
- 9-rule symptom diagnosis with severity + remedies
- 7-item FAQ knowledge base
- Trilingual (EN/HI/MR) keyword matching + response translations
- Timestamped message bubbles, alert banners
